The Unity Associate Game Developer course involves several projects.

Unity projects can be saved and restored as zips:
   1. select the Assets, Packages, and Project Settings folders
   2. create a zip of those three folders
   3. rename the zip to include the student and project name

If there is not a great deal of personalization, they can more simply be
exported and re-imported as .unitypackage files:
   1. in Project window, right-click the Assets folder and select Export Package
   2. in the resulting dialog, select Export
   3. save the package with a student name and version number

But, by the time they reach upper division, all of our students should already 
have their own GitHub accounts and be familiar with basic git operations.  Thus
the preferred submission format may be git commits and pushes.
This repo is a template for the projects in the Associate Game Developer course.
Students will be told to fork it in order to create their own repos for that course.
